    This should be the first place you go to look when you're stuck or confused
    with something. It's one of my favorite Neovim features.

    MOST IMPORTANTLY, we provide a keymap "<space>sh" to [s]earch the [h]elp documentation,
    which is very useful when you're not exactly sure of what you're looking for.

  I have left several `:help X` comments throughout the init.lua
    These are hints about where to find more information about the relevant settings,
    plugins or Neovim features used in Kickstart.

-- Set <space> as the leader key
-- See `:help mapleader`
--  NOTE: Must happen before plugins are loaded (otherwise wrong leader will be used)
vim.g.mapleader = ' '
vim.g.maplocalleader = ' '

-- Set to true if you have a Nerd Font installed and selected in the terminal
vim.g.have_nerd_font = true

-- [[ Setting options ]]
require("options")

-- [[ Basic Keymaps ]]
require("keymaps")

-- [[ Install `lazy.nvim` plugin manager ]]
require("lazy-bootstrap")

-- [[ Configure and install plugins ]]
require("lazy-plugins")

-- The line beneath this is called `modeline`. See `:help modeline`
-- vim: ts=2 sts=2 sw=2 et
